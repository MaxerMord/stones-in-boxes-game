# stones-in-boxes-game

The stones in boxes game.

##Rules
15 small boxes arranged in a line. Each box except one contains a piece of stone. (Thus, there is one empty box. When a game is started the program chooses a box to be the empty one randomly.) Players move in turn. In a move, a player must take away a stone from a box or two stones from two adjacent boxes. The winner of the game is the player who makes the last move.
